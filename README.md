# IMDB reviews - sentiment analysis

In this project I perform sentiment analysis on film reviews from IMDB. I use three classification models: Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network (perceptron) to determine whether an opinion is positive or negative.



Using train set containing 40k reviews and test set containing 5k reviews I obtain accuracy:

72.16% (Naive Bayes Classifier)

86.82% (Logistic Regression)

87.58% (ANN)
